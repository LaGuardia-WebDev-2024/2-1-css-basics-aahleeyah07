    <h1>Axolotl</h1>
    <p>The <em>Axolotl</em> is awesome because they can regenerate almost everything! They can regenerate their limbs, spinal cord, heart, and other organs too! They also glow under blacklight. When Bill Cipher was gonna die he called upon the ancient Axolotl and I love gravity falls! Most of the are also pink so theyre extra cute.<strong></strong></p>
